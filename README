THE WEBSITE
1 Use html/Css
2 CSS frameworks like bootstrap or tailwind are ok but don’t use javascript frameworks like react/vue
3 Organize the text to create a hero and/or about section
“We specialise in design,Canvas painting,Multimedia art and printing on t-shirts, sculpture,textile and
others”
“Actions speak louder than words. Disability is not inability”
4 Choose 10 photos (any photos) from the facebook page and create a slider/photo gallery (in
whatever way you think is best)
4.1 Put all the photos you use in this folder . The folder already includes the logo.
5 Create a contact us section.
